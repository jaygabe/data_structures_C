# Recursion

## What is Recursion?

Recursion is a function that calls itself. Inside this function, there must be a condition that stops the recursive function from calling itself which we call the "base case" and ensures the recursive functions STOPS/TERMINATES.

Without this base case, the recursive function may run forever or exceed the call stack leading to errors.

## Tracing Recursion

"Tracing" refers to the process of following the execution of a recursive function as its calls itself and eventually resolves to a base case. Tracing helps you understand how the recursive calls are happening and how the function works step by step.

When you trace a recursive function, you are essentially examining the sequence of function calls, their arguments, and the values returned at each step. This can be a helpful technique for understanding the flow of execution and identifying any patterns or issues in the recursive algorithm.

## Stack Used in Recursion

When you start a new process, the process will create a space in memory for the code, the stack, and the heap. A stack is commonly used in recursion to keep track of function calls and their local variables.

As the program begins executing from the main function,
